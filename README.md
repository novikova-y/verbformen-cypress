# Test & Learn: Cypress + German

Welcome to my project! This repository is a combination of two passions: my love for the German language and my desire to learn Cypress and the Page Object Model (POM) for automated testing.

## What is This Project About?
In this project, I use Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework, to test websites in German. By doing so, I'm not only enhancing my skills in automation testing but also integrating my German language learning into the process. The Page Object Model (POM) is applied to keep the test code clean, reusable, and maintainable.

## Why German + Cypress + POM?

### German Language
I'm learning German and decided to incorporate this journey into my technical skills. By testing German-language websites, I can improve both my language proficiency and automation testing abilities simultaneously.

### Cypress
A powerful tool for end-to-end testing that helps automate the testing process, making it faster and more reliable.

### POM (Page Object Model)
An important design pattern for organizing test code. It improves maintainability, scalability, and readability, making it easier to work with larger test suites.

## How Does It Work?

### Cypress Tests
I write Cypress tests for German-language websites. Each test interacts with elements on the website, ensuring the user experience is as expected.

### POM
For better organization and maintainability, I implement the Page Object Model. Each webpage or component has its own class, and actions related to that page are defined as methods.

### German-Language Websites
The tests target websites in German, so I get the chance to engage with the language while coding.

## What You Will Find Here
- **Cypress Test Cases:** Automated tests written in Cypress.
- **POM Implementation:** Code organized using the Page Object Model for better structure.
- **German Language Learning:** Practical examples of how I integrate German into my automation process.
